# JavaScript study

Documenting my process of studying the JavaScript language to keep myself accountable and reach completion.

## Fundamentals:

- Markdown for documentation
- Scripting inside HTML files
- Using external JS scripts
- Accessing the browser console
- Code structure: statements, semicolons, comments
- Use Strict
- Variables: variable naming, constants, naming things right
- Data types: numbers, `BigInt`, strings, `Boolean` (logical operations), the `"undefined"` value, objects and symbols, and the `typeof` operator
- Interaction: `alert`, `prompt`, `confirm`
- Type coversions: string, numeric and Boolean
