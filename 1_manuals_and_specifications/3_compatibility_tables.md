# Compatibility tables

JavaScript is a developing language, new features get added regularly.

To see their support among browser-based and other engines, see:

https://caniuse.com – per-feature tables of support, e.g. to see which engines support modern cryptography functions: https://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography.
https://kangax.github.io/compat-table – a table with language features and engines that support those or don’t support.
All these resources are useful in real-life development, as they contain valuable information about language details, their support, etc.

Please remember them (or this page) for the cases when you need in-depth information about a particular feature.
