# Type Conversions

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert the values given to them to the right type. <br>

For example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers. <br>

There are also cases when we need explicitly covert a value to the expected type. <br>
