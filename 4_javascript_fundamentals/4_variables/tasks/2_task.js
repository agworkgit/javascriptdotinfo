// Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
// Note, we could use a shorter name planet, but it might not be obvious what planet it refers to. Itâ€™s nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.

let ourPlanetName = "Earth";

// Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?

let currentUserName = "John";
